                <p>We’re often so busy during our daily lives that our sense of motivation needs some serious boosting.
                    Inspiration is even harder to come by when we’re lacking in motivation. But nothing a little music
                    couldn’t cure. So start listening to some of these playlists to lift your mood and you just might be
                    inspired along the way. I personally fall in love with music No matter what cucumstance I'm in.
                    Music is
                    just something that can make me relate get hit up to do something right.Some forms of music are
                    extremely inspirational due to the powerful words contained in the lyrics. Strong lyrics can create
                    a story, which can inspire emotion within the listener. Whether it’s a song about love, loss, lust,
                    or the hardships of life, there is always going one person who can connect with what the song is
                    saying, and consequently becomes inspired by it. </p>

                <h2> ART Isn't Just About Drawing</h2>
                <img src="./Images/art.jpg" alt="music" width="100%">
                <br></br>
                <p>There are so many element in just the word "ART". It about creativity, passion and derterminatino.
                    There are so many type and ways to shows art. It include painting, drawing, music, photo/videography
                    and even the new style that base on each generation. My personal favorite type of ART are drawing,
                    performing art, video/photography and a little bit of painting. I started to take art class when I
                    was 11. Everytime I step in the class, there's a feeling that make me feel passionate about my
                    design. I love these kind of art, because I can just be who I am. I always want to make people feel
                    inspired and motivated. I want them to be happy. When I start to like performing art, I realize I
                    can fulfill my goal using my talent. I'm not an expert, but hopefully, I'll be able to inspire
                    someone using ART. </p>
